VideoAutosplitterProto is a prototype of a 'video auto splitter' in development for [LiveSplit](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit).

Official support will not be available until, minimally, a beta release. If you download this to try it without notifying me (ROMaster2), do not expect any help as things are still in alpha development.
